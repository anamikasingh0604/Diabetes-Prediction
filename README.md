# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Model
Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various health metrics. The primary goal is to provide a robust, accurate, and interpretable model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains 768 samples of female patients with 8 health-related attributes.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Model
This project uses several machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The final model selection is based on the evaluation metrics and performance on the validation dataset.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC AUC
